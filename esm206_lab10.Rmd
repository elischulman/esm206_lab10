library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

## Beep + for loop
```{r}
# beep() make a noise depending on the number
beepr::beep(9)

# use for loop + beep
for(i in rev(seq(1:5))) {
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
}

# beep() in this case creates a sound after the for loop has completed 
beep(9)
```

## Praise is nice
```{r}
praise("${EXCLAMATION}!!! This code works ${adverb_manner} well")
```

## Cowsay to have characters say something
```{r}
say("Hello World!", by = "rms")
